Setup:
* composer needs to be installed and runnable from the command prompt
* in the vertex directory run "composer install".  This should create a "vendor" directory and pull in
  required dependencies

Running Tests:
* tests can be run from the vertex directory using the phpunit executable that composer downloads
  into the vendor directory:

  # run all tests
  van@van-dev-vm:vertex$ vendor/bin/phpunit

  # run a single test
  van@van-dev-vm:vertex$ vendor/bin/phpunit tests/facts/someTest.php
