 * Class FactPortfolioTest
 *
 * NOTE:  the verse is kind of f@#$ for use as a reference:
 * 	1.  verse_fact_portfolio has 18 loans removed by hand(?), specifically for partner 337.  Here they are:
 * 			620414 ,654797 ,675808 ,696375 ,620419 ,623001 ,642511 ,669507 ,695816 ,629129 ,650591 ,669512, 675798, 675805 ,676510 ,695827 ,718003 ,718010
 *
 *  2.  there are instances where verse_fact_portfolio is out of sync with reality, like for loan_id 779560. (refunded, loan price 2450.00)
 * 		For this loan, the sum(total) is $1750 in verse_fact_portfolio.  But, the kiva db llp sum (and ods sum) is $1925.  Excluding promos (which we're not doing here anyway), the llp sum is $1850.
 * 		So... WTF.  I'm using the ods as the source of truth, not the verse here.
 *
 *  3.  There are 2 historical loans where the llps don't add up to loan price for ended loans: see testTotalForRaisedLoans()
